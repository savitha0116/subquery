1.RANK(): Skips the next rank if there's a tie.
Example: If two people are tied for 1st, the next rank is 3rd.
 RANK(): B and C are tied at rank 2, so D is at rank 4 (skipping 3).

2. DENSE_RANK(): Doesn't skip ranks. 
Example: If two people are tied for 1st, the next rank is 2nd.
DENSE_RANK(): B and C are tied at rank 2, so D is at rank 3 (no gap).
